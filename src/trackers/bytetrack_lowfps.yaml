# ByteTrack configuration tuned for low-FPS, small boats
# Reference: Ultralytics tracker config schema (ByteTrack)
# Key parameters adapted:
# - track_high_thresh: low to keep more tentative tracks at low fps
# - track_low_thresh: lower to accept detections with lower conf between keyframes
# - new_track_thresh: equal/close to track_high_thresh to create tracks easily
# - match_thresh: bit lower to allow looser association when motion is large per frame
# - camera_motion: false assuming static camera; set true if panning

tracker_type: bytetrack

mot20: false
track_high_thresh: 0.3
track_low_thresh: 0.05
new_track_thresh: 0.3
match_thresh: 0.7
track_buffer: 80  # number of frames to keep lost tracks; helps low-FPS continuity
min_box_area: 10
fuse_score: false  # required by recent Ultralytics; set true to fuse detection score in association

# Kalman filter and ioU-similar settings (kept defaults if not sure)
frame_rate: 10  # used by some heuristics; align with your video fps

# Optional: appearance embedding disabled for classic ByteTrack
proximity_thresh: 0.5
appearance_thresh: 0.25

# If the camera is moving, set:
# use_byte: true
# camera_motion: true
